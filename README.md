# bubble-sort-
This is a bubble sort function and works in the same way as the conventional bubble sort algorithm. The function iterates through the array passed to it as an argument and swaps the positions of numbers if the one before it is larger than the one after it. The returned array should look the same as using the sort method.
For example:
bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=>[0,2,2,3,4,78]
